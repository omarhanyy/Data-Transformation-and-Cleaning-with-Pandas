# Data Transformation and Cleaning with Pandas

## Energy Indicators:

#### I Cleaned and Joined the files then answered the following Questions:

+ What is the average GDP over the last 10 years for each country? 
+ What is the mean Energy Supply per Capita?
+ What country has the maximum % Renewable and what is the percentage?
+ Create a new column that is the ratio of Self-Citations to Total Citations. What is the maximum value for this new column, and what country has the highest ratio?
+ Create a new column with a 1 if the country's % Renewable value is at or above the median for all countries in the top 15, and a 0 if the country's % Renewable value is below the median.
